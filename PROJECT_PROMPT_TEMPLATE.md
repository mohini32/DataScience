## üéØ Efficient Prompting Examples

### **Example 1: Complete Project Request**
```
"Build a complete task management web app with:
- User registration/login
- Create, edit, delete tasks
- Task categories and priorities
- Due date reminders
- Export to CSV

Tech: Python + FastAPI + SQLite + HTML/CSS frontend
Timeline: ASAP, simple but functional

## üí° Pro Tips for Maximum Efficiency

### **‚úÖ DO:**
- Be specific about functionality
- Request complete files, not snippets
- Ask for project structure first
- Mention any existing code to integrate with
- Specify error handling needs
- Request documentation and examples

### **‚ùå AVOID:**
- Vague descriptions like "make it good"
- Asking for just explanations when you want code
- Forgetting to mention deployment requirements
- Not specifying user interface needs
